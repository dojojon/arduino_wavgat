# Arklow Coder Dojo - Notes for Arduino Clone

This repository is for the quick download and set up of software to use with the WAVGAT Arduino Uno clone. 

## Directories on USB (not on github)

* ch431 - Drivers for serial communication to wavgat
* ide - Arduino ide packages
* wavgat - WavGat packages
* wavgat-ide - Non admin arduino ide with wavgat packages installed

## Set Up

For most installing the ch430g drivers and the wavget-ide.zip extracted will be enough for the lessons.

You will need local administrator permissions on your computer to install the ch430g drivers.

1. Install the ch431 drivers by running the CH431SER.exe drivers
1. Expand the wavget-ide.zip
